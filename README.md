# beaker-vmpooler

Beaker library to use vmpooler hypervisor

# Spec tests

Spec test live under the `spec` folder. There are the default rake task and therefore can run with a simple command:
```bash
bundle exec rake test:spec
```

# Acceptance tests

We run beaker's base acceptance tests with this library to see if the hypervisor is working with beaker. There is a simple rake task to invoke acceptance test for the library:
```bash
bundle exec rake test:acceptance
